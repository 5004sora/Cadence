# Hack the Burgh V - Reckless
Submission for Hack the Burgh V:

This was the submission of my group "Reckless" for the Hack the Burgh V Hackathon in 2019. It is a simple matching algorithm that uses NLP to match queries with existing test sentences. The idea behind the project is to bring minority entrepreneurs and possible sponsors together. Minority entrepreneurs may not have the same opportunities as others to acquire sufficient funding for their businesses, and as a result we wanted to facilitate this process.

About the program:

The function takes two parameters, the user input and a list of possible sponsor schemes. The program then determines the similarity between the user input and each sponsor scheme available based on some rules we designed. Once the similarities have been calculated, the schemes are sorted from most relevant to least relevant and returned to the user. 

What next?

Initially we had planned to make an App, with this simple search engine as the backend. However, we as we had never done NLP before, we were only able to implement the backend in the time available. In the future, we will look to work on the UI and improve the backend further.
